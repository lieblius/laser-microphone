The files in the profiling folder are responsible for noise profiling and creating the files in the kernels folder.
apply_profile.py utilizes the noise profiling kernels in the kernels folder and applies them to the audio. This script
is imported into main.py along with utils.py (contains utility functions) and spectral.py (contains spectral subtraction
and gating functions). main.py handles the recording and playback of audio as well as reading and writing from audio
files depending on the settings. Also the FIR_lab3 files are for use on the Teensy and are applied as described in the
installation instructions.
