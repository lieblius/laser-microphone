After the code is uploaded on the Teensy it will run automatically when powered. Once the Raspberry Pi and Teensy are
set up like lab3 with the photodetector circuit replacing the microphone input, main.py can be run. In the latest and
currently submitted version of main.py, running main.py on its own will read an audio file and play it back after
processing. The initial version and expected use of main.py involves recording from the microphone and playing audio back
immediately after, it just requires inserting the amount of seconds to record for as a command line argument. Running
this would look like this: 'python main.py 10' to record for 5 seconds. Keep in mind the minimum record time is 3 seconds
and the first 3 seconds of input are expected to be purely noise. The program will exit after playback and can write to
a wav file if a configuration variable is set.
